title: Polymake.jl 0.4 has been released
author: Marek Kaluba

`Polymake.jl` 0.4 has been
[released](https://github.com/oscar-system/Polymake.jl/releases/tag/v0.4.0)!

Since we're upgrading to support `CxxWrap.jl` 0.10.1, we decided to bump the major 
version to force compilation of libpolymake against libcxxwrap-julia. 
The release has been somewhat hastened by the need for
[`Oscar.jl`](https://github.com/oscar-system/Oscar.jl) jointly working with 
the newest `CxxWrap.jl`, so expect 0.4.1 and later minor versions rather heavy
in added features :).

<br/>
_Note_:
We're tracking the version of libcxxwrap-julia used, so that we can warn you
whenever executing `import Pkg; Pkg.build("Polymake")` is necessary, but some of the cases
might have slipped us. If you experience crashes while `using Polymake` try:
 * `import Pkg; Pkg.free("CxxWrap")`,
 * `import Pkg; Pkg.build("Polymake")`,
 * [filing a bug report!](https://github.com/oscar-system/Polymake.jl/issues)

Below you can find a summary of the major changes and design decision we have 
taken in the development of `Polymake.jl`.

<br/>
Happy coding,<br/>

# Changes between Polymake.jl 0.3 and 0.4

## Library updates

* `Polymake.jl` can now be used with `CxxWrap` 0.10.1 or later
* `Polymake.jl` uses `LoadFlint.jl` and latest `SingularBuilder`

## New features

* documentation strings of all `polymake` functions and methods was made 
available in julia 
* handling of polynomials should be much smoother
* polymake banner is suppressed when imported in `Oscar.jl`

## Fixed notable bugs

* `libpolymake` no longer requires GLIBCXX_3.4.26, i.e. `Polymake.jl` is 
compatible with libstdc++ shipped by julia, even when using very modern Linux 
systems (big thanks to Max Horn for investigating!)
* polymake doesn't grab all interrupts, so after `using Polymake` one can 
still Ctrl^C to interrupt julia. However...

## Known Bugs:

* a Ctrl^C interrupt issued during computations in `polymake` may render 
involved objects into incomplete state which is leads to segfault at `exit()`. 
We can not exclude silent data corruption in the process, so please DO NOT DO 
IT. We will be looking into a proper solution in the near future.
